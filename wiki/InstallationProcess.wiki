# Unzip archive in user folder of Matlab. Under windows this folder is usually called something like C:\Users\muellerf\Documents\MATLAB, where muellerf is the user name. In Matlab the user path can be found with the command userpath. There should now be a folder C:\Users\muellerf\Documents\MATLAB\FISH_QUANT.

#Add folder with subfolder to Matlab path definition. This can be done with a few simple steps in Matlab
a.	In the Matlab menu select File > Set Path
b.	This will open a dialog box. In this box select Add with subfolders â€¦
c.	This will open another dialog. Here select the folder of FISH_Quant from step 1, e.g. C:\Users\muellerf\Documents\MATLAB\FISH_Quant. Click OK.
d.	To save this settings press on Save. Depending on the settings of the installation of Matlab this might results in a warning saying that the changes to path cannot be saved. Matlab proposes to save the path-definition file pathdef.m to another location. Click on Yes. Select a directory of choice, e.g. the Matlab work directory of the user C:\Users\muellerf\Documents\MATLAB.
