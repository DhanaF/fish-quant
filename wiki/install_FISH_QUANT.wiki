= Requirements =

Functions were programmed and tested for Matlab 7.11. The following toolboxes are needed
 * Optimization toolbox 
 * Image processing toolbox
 * (Optional) Parallel processing toolbox


= Matlab code =

 * *Unzip archive* in user folder of Matlab. Under windows this folder is usually called something like C:\Users\muellerf\Documents\MATLAB, where muellerf is the user name. In Matlab the user path can be found with the command _userpath_. There should now be a folder C:\Users\muellerf\Documents\MATLAB\FISH_QUANT.

 * A PDF with *detailed instructions* on how to install and used FISH-QUANT can be found in the extraced archive.

 * Before running FISH-QUANT the *Matlab path definition* has to be updated. Instruction on how to do this can be found in the above mentioned PDF. 

= MIJ â€“ Interface between Matlab and Imagej = 
FISH QUANT uses the software package [http://bigwww.epfl.ch/sage/soft/mij/ MIJ] to visualize results in ImageJ. The package will be automatically installed during the installation process. More detailed description can be found on the website http://bigwww.epfl.ch/sage/soft/mij/. 

*IMPORTANT*
It is recommend that the Java Heap Memory is increased when MIJ is used. See MIJ web-site for details. This is especially important if large images are processed and viewed.
